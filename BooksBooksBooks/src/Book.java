public class Book {
    /*
    REQUIRED FOR APPROACHING EXPECTATIONS
        Create a program with a class called Book, that contains at least two constructors
            (things you might want to initialize in your constructor include book title, author, genre, pages, etc. - you decide!)
            - forcing to use overloaded constructor to get used to concept
        Create a class Main in which you house your main method.
        Create at least 4 different book objects, 2 using each constructor
        Give each book at least 3 ratings using an addRatings method (ratings should be between 0 and 5 stars).
            - Meaning you have to create that addRatings method yourself!
        Print out all the information for each book in a neatly formatted manner
        Add comments to your code describing what is happening
    REQUIRED FOR MEETS EXPECTATIONS
        All the stuff above, plus:
        Instead of selecting ratings, use Math.random to assign random ratings to books (still between 0 and 5)
    REQUIRED FOR EXCEEDS EXPECTATIONS
        All the stuff above, plus:
        Calculate and print the following data about your book objects:
                - The total pages in all of your books combined
                - The total number of characters (letters, symbols, and spaces) in all the book titles combined
                - The first letter of each author's name, concatenated together
                - The last letter of each book's title, concatenated together
                - The average rating of all the books' average ratings
                    - Using ONLY the addRatings method (itâ€™s okay if the ratings randomize again I just want you to get comfortable using dot.notation)
                      you created in your Book program/class and the String methods substring and length
        Comment your new code
        Ensure your output is neatly formatted
